For this investigation we're solving the equation *A**x*** = ***b***, given an *n* x *n* matrix *A* and a vector ***b***, using an algorithm.

## Condition number
Given a perturbed input ***b****, the larger the condition number of a matrix, the further away an algorithm will be from the solution ***x***.

# Investigation
We'll examine the condition number of many different dimensions of matrix. For each dimension, we'll take the average condition number of 15 random matrices and then plot those against the dimension. This will give a visualisation of how the condition number behaves with increasing dimensions.
